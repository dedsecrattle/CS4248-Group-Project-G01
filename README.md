# CS4248-Group-Project-G01

This project aims to develop an efficient Extractive QA system using the Retrospective Reader model, focusing on improving accuracy and real-time performance for tasks like search engines and virtual assistants. It will be evaluated on benchmark datasets like SQuAD 2.0 to ensure effectiveness with both answerable and unanswerable questions.

## Training the Model

To train the model and generate predicition on Validation Set, use the following command and set `train = True` in the `main()` function

```bash
python retro-reader.py
```
